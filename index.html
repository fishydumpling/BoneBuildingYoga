    <div class="FlowOne">Laraine’s bone building yoga program is based on a National Institute of Health study,
       which found that yoga is “…a safe and effective means to reverse bone loss in the spine 
       and femur.” The study also noted “improved bone quality.” You can read the study here:

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <div class="FlowTwo">
    "I have been taking Laraine’s yoga classes (Yoga for Bone Building and Gentle Yoga) for many years. Not only has this led this to a much higher fitness and flexibility level, but I also took charge of my health naturally. My bone density scores improved significantly (without medication) thanks to her classes. She adapts her classes to everyone's needs, gives various options for many of the postures, and reduces the stress of her students by readings, quotes and motivational mantras. The quiet period at the end, Savasana, sends everybody on their way relaxed, calm and ready for whatever comes next. 

"I took yoga for decades in various studios, rec centers, etc., but NONE of them was as good and as effective as Laraine's classes. It is also the first time I found an instructor skilled in Yoga for Osteoporosis. I hope that she will teach for many many years to come."
